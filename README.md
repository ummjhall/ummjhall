## Hello, I'm Justin

The seeds of my software engineering journey were planted with a college introductory programming course. I was on a different trajectory, one that led me to rewarding years overseas. But destined to return to this path, I have dived head-first into this exciting lifelong career. Developing my skill set through intense comprehensive training, graduating from the highly-regarded App Academy, I am now creating full stack web applications while growing my expertise every day.
